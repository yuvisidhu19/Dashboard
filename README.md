# Dashboard
A dashboard is a visual display of any data. In this project, I took a covid-19 dataset from kaggle.com and made a dashboard using the 'dash' library and designed various kinds of graphs using 'plotly' library like world map, pie charts and an interactive bar graph.
This dashboard is hosted on http://127.0.0.1:8050/ and it can be accessed after you run it on the compiler.
# Screenshots

This is an interactive bar graph. At the right side of this graph, You will see the name of WHO regions (its a column in dataset) and you can access details of each region by clicking on the specific region.
