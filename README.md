# Dashboard
A dashboard is a visual display of any data. In this project, I took a covid-19 dataset from kaggle.com and made a dashboard using the 'dash' library and designed various kinds of graphs using 'plotly' library like world map, pie charts and an interactive bar graph.
This dashboard is hosted on the local host link after you run it in the compiler.
